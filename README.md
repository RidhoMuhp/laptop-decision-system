## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **rule-based decision system** built with Python to recommend laptops based on user needs such as budget, minimum RAM, and usage purpose.

The main goal of this project is to practice **AI-style decision logic**, including reasoning, scoring, and explainable recommendations.

## How the System Works
The system follows a structured decision-making process:

1. **Knowledge Base**  
   Laptop specifications are stored as structured data.

2. **User Requirements**  
   User needs such as budget, minimum RAM, and intended usage are defined as input.

3. **Rules Engine**  
   General rules evaluate each laptop against user requirements.

4. **Scoring & Ranking**  
   Each laptop is scored and ranked based on how well it satisfies the rules.

5. **Explainable Output**  
   The system provides reasons explaining why a laptop is recommended.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Rule-based logic
- Dictionary-based data modeling

---

## Example Use Case
- Selecting a laptop for **coding** within a limited budget
- Comparing multiple laptops objectively
- Understanding decision logic behind recommendations

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add hard constraints (mandatory requirements)
- Support dynamic rule weights
- Load laptop data from external files (CSV/JSON)
- Refactor into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
